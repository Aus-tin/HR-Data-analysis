Analysis on HR Attrition

A recent Project carried out by me on HR Attrition Analysis, which is aimed at unveiling the reason behind the high volume of staff resignations/reduction  @ REAL O TECHNOLOGIES LTD.

The Word "Attrition" in a company  simply implies the act of staff members leaving their organisations for several reasons.

REAL O TECHNOLOGIES LTD Is a software programming company which has been suffering from employee high rate of attrition, hence resulting to deficiency of work flow due to under staffing system, and some other negative factors which isn't favourable to the  company's growth.

However, the Objective if this Data analysis project is to carry out an analysis on HR and Employees data, which includes: Job roles, Performance rating,  Demography, and Job satisfaction rating to unveil the primary reason  and predictors for the high level  attrition of staff members.

By leveraging on this data, I am targeted
to developing a predictive models which can enable the HR department and the entire management of REAL O TECHNOLOGIES LTD to make a proactive decision and steps in reducing the attrition rate, thus improving employee retention thereby creating a more satisfying, conducive, nice staffing and working system for all members of staff.

RECOMMENDATION
Based on my analysis carried out, I strongly recommend that REAL O TECHNOLOGIES LTD should:

> Address the identified issues and improve the overall work force dynamics within the organisation

> Conduct an Exit interview with staff members, as this will help to understand the reason behind the massive resignation of staff, especially the female employees who are facing high rate of attrition

> Carry out equity salary review, as this will equally help identify and address any gender disparities  and compensation

> Develop retention strategies, which will obviously aid to reduce attrition rate, specifically among female staff who are experiencing high attrition rate, compared to the Male employees

> Promote work-life balance, as this will create a supportive work environment  that prioritize work-life balance and general staff well-being

> Adopt regular communication and feedback method between management and staff to address concerns, gather feedback and ensure that employees feel heard and valued

> Consistently monitor and evaluate the  progress towards attrition rate and employee satisfaction metrics to track the effectiveness of retention strategies overtime.

I am confident that by implementing these recommendations, REAL O TECHNOLOGIES can work towards creating a more inclusive and suitable work environment for all their staff members, thus resulting to very low or zero percentage of attrition rate.[HR DATA Attrition Analysis.xlsx](https://github.com/Aus-tin/HR-Data-analysis/files/14625479/HR.DATA.Attrition.Analysis.xlsx)
